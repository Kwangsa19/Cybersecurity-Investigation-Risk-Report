## Scenario 1

### Investigation Report
In this task, you will be stepping into the role of a cybersecurity consultant here at XYZ. One of our leading tech corporation clients has fallen prey to a sophisticated cyberattack by a notorious Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group known as APT34. The attack, believed to be sponsored by a foreign government, has left the organisation's network compromised, and valuable customer data and intellectual property has been stolen.

Your mission is to conduct initial research on this APT group, APT34, and assess the extent of the breach's impact on the organisation's information security. But fear not, for you will be provided with all the necessary tools required to understand cybersecurity concepts and principles, including cyberthreats, attack methods, and the importance of confidentiality, integrity and availability of information. In addition, you will also be familiarised with APT34's tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) and the common vulnerabilities they exploit to gain access to networks.

The objective of this task is to help our client conduct an initial investigation into APT34 and evaluate the potential impact of the attack on the organization. As a result, you will need to produce a comprehensive report documenting your findings and outlining key recommendations for improving the organisation's cybersecurity posture.

As you delve deeper into the world of cybersecurity, you will come to appreciate the critical role it plays in protecting organisations against cyberthreats. With the ever-increasing reliance on technology and the internet, cybersecurity has become a vital aspect of any organisation's operations. It is no longer a question of whether an organisation will be targeted but rather a question of when. This task provides you with an excellent opportunity to learn and gain practical experience in the cybersecurity field while making a positive impact on our client's security posture.
