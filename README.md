# Investigation & Risk Assessment
> This project is inspired by Datacom cybersecurity virtual job simulation via [Forage](https://www.theforage.com/simulations/datacom/cybersecurity-zm6d). 

## Scenario 1 Investigation 

In this task, you will be stepping into the role of a cybersecurity consultant here at XYZ. One of our leading tech corporation clients has fallen prey to a sophisticated cyberattack by a notorious Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group, known as APT34. The attack, believed to be sponsored by a foreign government, has left the organisation's network compromised, and valuable customer data and intellectual property has been stolen.

Your mission is to conduct initial research on this APT group, APT34, and assess the extent of the breach's impact on the organisation's information security. But fear not, for you will be provided with all the necessary tools required to understand cybersecurity concepts and principles, including threats, attack methods, and the importance of confidentiality, integrity and availability of information. In addition, you will also be familiarised with APT34's tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) and the common vulnerabilities they exploit to gain access to networks.

The objective of this task is to help our client conduct an initial investigation into APT34 and evaluate the potential impact of the attack on the organization. As a result, you will need to produce a comprehensive report documenting your findings and outlining key recommendations for improving the organisation's cybersecurity posture.

As you delve deeper into the world of cybersecurity, you will come to appreciate the critical role it plays in protecting organisations against cyber threats. With the ever-increasing reliance on technology and the internet, cybersecurity has become a vital aspect of any organisation's operations. It is no longer a question of whether an organisation will be targeted but rather a question of when. This task provides you with an excellent opportunity to learn and gain practical experience in the cybersecurity field while making a positive impact on our client's security posture.

## Solution Investigation
Based on [MITRE ATT&CK Framework](https://attack.mitre.org/) and Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) tools:

APT34

1. What is their history? <br>
Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group 34, also known as OilRig or HelixKitten, is an Iranian-linked hacking group and a state-sponsored cyber espionage group that has been active since 2014. 

2. Which nation/state are they associated with? <br>
APT34 has been associated with the Iranian government. Some cybersecurity experts believe that they are a part of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), a powerful military organisation that is also involved in Iran's cyber operations.

3. Do they target specific industries? <br>
A wide range of industries have been targeted, such as energy, finance, telecommunications and government agencies, mostly in the Middle East and the United States. They collect sensitive information and conduct cyber espionage activities on behalf of the Iranian government.

4. What are their motives? <br>
The motives are espionage-related stuff. They target sensitive information such as intellectual property, financial data and government secrets. Some sources state that they conduct cyber crimes on behalf of the Iranian government. 

5. What are the TTPs (tactics, techniques and procedures) they use to conduct their attacks? <br>
Some of their classic techniques are but are not limited to: Spear-phishing, social engineering, malware delivery through malicious websites (customer malware, a backdoor called POWRUNNER and custom command-and-control) and password spraying. Once they gain access to the network, APT34 will try to avoid being detected and remain in the system to launch an attack at the right time. 

6. What security measures could the client implement to defend against cyberattacks conducted by this APT? <br>

* Employee training: Educate the employee about cyber threats will prevent them from falling into traps of cyber criminals. 
* Multi-factor authentication (MFA): It is a great way to protect identity if the hackers manage to steal one of credentials. By implementing Multi-factor authentication, the attackers might have to find more than one way to gain access.
* Endpoint protection: Anti-virus and anti-malware can protect us from known threats.
* Network segmentation: Segmenting the networks into smaller networks to prevent the spread of the malware should the breach occurs.
* Incident response plan: Implement incident response plan to respond quickly should cyber threats occur.  

 
## Scenario 2 Risk Assessment

Your initial research on the APT group is a crucial step because it helps to identify the potential attackers and their methods, motives and targets. Understanding the TTPs of APT34 helps identify specific vulnerabilities and attack vectors that could be exploited. 

This has laid a solid foundation for the next task, which is to conduct a comprehensive risk assessment for the client. The client has a fence around the perimeter of its property and a padlock on its entrance gate to prevent unauthorised access. However, the leadership team is concerned about potential risks and vulnerabilities that could compromise the security of its information and systems. They require a comprehensive risk assessment to identify potential security threats and vulnerabilities in their system or network.

As a cybersecurity consultant, you understand that conducting a risk assessment is an essential component of any effective cybersecurity strategy. This involves identifying, evaluating and prioritising potential security threats and vulnerabilities to determine the level of risk and develop a plan to mitigate those risks. During the risk assessment, you will need to identify the assets that need to be protected, define the risk matrix and identify potential risk scenarios. You will assess the risk ratings for each scenario, both with and without existing measures in place. Finally, you will provide a risk assessment report to the client summarising your findings and recommendations for mitigating risks and improving the institution's security posture.

The goal of the risk assessment is to help the client prioritise and implement appropriate security measures to mitigate and minimise risks. This will ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of their information and systems, as well as protect their reputation and financial resources. Ultimately, your work will help the client comply with regulatory and legal requirements and standards and provide peace of mind knowing that their security is being handled by a knowledgeable and experienced cybersecurity expert.
